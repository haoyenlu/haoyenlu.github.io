<p>This class teaches the fundamental math for computer science, including induction, logic, NP-problem, Euler Theorem, graph, etc. To pass this course, I have tried to write down all the theorem and explanation inside this note. This note concludes all the class material in a more concise way, which helps me to review all the material before the test. I really like this course because I like to solve math problem and want to improve my knowledge in math.
