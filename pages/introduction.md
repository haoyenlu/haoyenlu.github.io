        Hi, I am Hao-En Lu. I come from Taiwan. I am currently a graduate student who is working on getting M.S. Degree in Computer Science. This portfolio is meant to give others who are interested in me an insight into my work and my life. Furthermore, I hope this portfolio is able to help my application in my future career. This portfolio will show some personal projects I have worked on, and my academic course works. Some coursework will also be provided in this portfolio to show my experience in certain areas. Other interests like dancing or playing chess will also be indicated here to show my personal growth. In the future, some photos or videos of me traveling will also be presented in this portfolio for people to participate in my personal life.

        Currently, I am in the graduate pathway program at George Mason University. This program has taught me a lot about the academic culture in the U.S., the way to do research, and English grammar. Additionally, there are two computer science courses in this program. One teaches us the fundamental math that will be used in the computer science field. Another teaches us the computer system structure, especially focusing on Linux System. GMU is a very beautiful campus. It is surrounded by trees and lake. There are several dining halls for students to grab some food. One of them operates 24 hours in week day, which is very convenient for students who need to work very late.
