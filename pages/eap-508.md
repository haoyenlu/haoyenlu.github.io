In this class, we need to do a research on a topic that is related to sustainable development, and present it in a colloqium.This is the poster that me and my teammate created for the colloqium. We studied the impact of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control in sustainable transportation. We determined how this model (Deep Reinforcement Learning) can help create a more sustainable city by reducing traffic congestion. Traffic congestion causes several problem, such as high fuel consumption, high air pollution, and time-consuming. It is important for current society to think about the way to mitigate traffic.
