This is one of the group assignment in this class. In this class, I have learned the academic culture in the U.S.A., and know the importance of activity engagement. Some of the assignments required students to read the material and present in class. I found this kind of assignment very useful for practicing public speakinig and summarizing the finding of the article. This course focuses on our soft skill rather that the subject knowledge. It enhances our abilities reagarding future career. I can truly notice my changes after this class.
